## Exploring the window object

This project uses the Window object to gather important information from users' devices. We learn about their operating system, language, and browser, which helps us make our website work better for them. We also find out the size of their screen and whether their device is plugged in and charging. This information helps us improve the website's performance and design to fit their device.

We even check if they're connected to the internet or not. All this data helps us create a website that adapts to what users need and how they're using it, making their online experience smoother and more enjoyable.
